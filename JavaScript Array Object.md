2. Finding (Primitive and Reference)
3. Combining & Splitting
4. Joining elements
5. Iterating 
6. Sorting, Reversing and Filtering
7. Testing elements  
8. Map & Reduce

## Adding, Emptying and Removing

push()
pop()
shift()
unshift()

## Finding/Searching

Finding elements by their index or value, both primitive and reference

includes()
find()

## Combining and Splitting

Joining two arrays together or split one into two

concat()
slice()

## Iterating

Looping through each element in an array

forEach()

for...of

## Joining the elements

put all the elements into a string separated by any character

join()

## Filtering and Sorting

categorizing values base on a condition, really powerful

filter()
sort()
reverse()

## Testing Elements

Testing every or some elements based on a condition

every()
some()

## Map & Reduce

map()
reduce()
