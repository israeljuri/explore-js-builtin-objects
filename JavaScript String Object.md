# Operations on **Strings**

**Array like values** are values that has are indexed and has a length property  eg. NodeList (DOM Objects), String, Argument (Object in functions)

Strings are array like values so they can be converted to and from Arrays

Values in a String are called character and each character are index from 0 up to the length of the string

Each character has a decimal representation eg. A = 65

1. Reading character(s) & Reading Decimal Form
2. Searching, Matching and Replacing
3. Combining and Splitting
4. Converting into an Array
5. Cases
6. Trimming and Padding
7. Locale

## Reading character(s)
