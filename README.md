# JavaScript-Built-in-Objects
Sometimes the likes of Lodash are just an overkill for the problem, that's basically why we even have these built-in objects. So here's A mental model to work with JavaScript Built in Objects.

# **Array**

1. Adding, Removing & Emptying
2. Finding (Primitive and Reference)
3. Combining & Splitting
4. Joining elements
5. Iterating 
6. Sorting, Reversing and Filtering
7. Testing elements  
8. Map & Reduce


# **Strings**

1. Reading character(s) & Reading Decimal Form
2. Searching, Matching and Replacing
3. Combining and Splitting
4. Cases
5. Trimming and Padding
6. Locale


# **Object**

1. Creating, Coping & Checking Objects
2. Making Object Immutability & and checking Immutability  (seal, freeze, extensible)
3. Getting Object Keys and Values
4. Converting Object Keys and Values to an Array and back to an Object
5. Getting and Setting Object Key(s) Characteristics (Enumerable, Writable, Configurable)
6. Getting Prototype
